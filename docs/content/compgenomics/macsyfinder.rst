What type of Macromolecular systems can be detected?
----------------------------------------------------------

* a broad range of secretion systems: T1SS, T2SS,T3SS,T4SS, T5SS, T6SS, T9SS, Flg, T4P, Tad (`Abby SS et al., Sci. Rep. 2016 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979785>`_)
* CRISPR-Cas systems: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) arrays and their associated Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins form the CRISPR-Cas system. CRISPR-Cas are sophisticated adaptive immune systems that rely on small RNAs for sequence-specific targeting of foreign nucleic acids such as viruses and plasmids.

What is MacSyFinder?
--------------------

Macromolecular System Finder (MacSyFinder) provides a flexible framework to model the properties of molecular systems (cellular machinery or pathway) including their components, evolutionary associations with other systems and genetic architecture.
Modelled features also include functional analogs, and the multiple uses of a same component by different systems.
Models are used to search for molecular systems in complete genomes or in unstructured data like metagenomes.
The components of the systems are searched by sequence similarity using Hidden Markov model (HMM) protein profiles.
The assignment of hits to a given system is decided based on compliance with the content and organization of the system model. 

Learn more about MacSyFinder `here <https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/software/macsyfinder-macsyview/>`_.

.. Don't use MacSyFinder as the name of the link since that would make
   a duplicate with the label.

What is CRISPRCasFinder ?
-------------------------

CRISPRCasFinder is a tool allowing to identify CRISPR arrays and Cas proteins. The CRISPR detection is based on 
`Vmatch <http://www.vmatch.de/>`_ (a software for large scale sequence analysis) which identify all repeat sequences regularly spaced. CRISPRCasFinder associate an evidence level with each CRISPR detected using 3 criteria :

* An entropy-based conservation index of repeats (EBcon);
* The number of spacers ;
* The overall percentage identity of spacers.

How to access to MacSyFinder and CRISPRCasFinder predictions?
----------------------------------------------------------

MacSyFinder and CRISPRCasFinder predictions are available through the **Comparative Genomics** section, in the main navigation menu.


What is the 'Macromolecular Systems' table?
--------------------------------------------------------

This table enumerates all macromolecular systems predicted for the selected organism and its replicons.

How to explore a Macromolecular System?
--------------------------------------------------------

The :ref: `MacSyFinder System visualization window <macromolecular-system-vizualization>`_ can be accessed by clicking on any cluster number in the System Id field. This window allows you to access to a detailled description of a selected Macromolecular System.

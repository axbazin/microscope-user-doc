Sequence and Genome selection
#############################

Since version 3.13.0, **MicroScope** the selection of sequences and genomes is based on a new selector
that has been designed to allow interactive and efficient selection of several sequences or genomes
in large lists.
It features selection based on several criteria and suggestions.

In this section, selection of **Genome** means that you are going to select the entire organism including all the replicons.
Selection of **Sequence** means that you are going to select the replicon you want to work on.
When talking indistinctively of genomes or sequence, we use the term *object*.

Sequences and genomes come either from **MicroScope** (PkGDB) or from **NCBI RefSeq**.

There are two kinds of selectors in the platform (the :ref:`simple-selector` and the :ref:`advanced-selector`) which are described in the following sections.
Generally speaking a page use either a simple selector or 1 or 2 advanced ones.
However, some pages use several selectors (of any type), from **PkGDB** or **NCBI RefSeq**.
For instance, the :ref:`keywords` page use a simple selector in single mode and
an advanced selector in multiple mode.

.. _simple-selector:

***************
Simple Selector
***************

This selector is used to select a single genome based on the strain name.
It's similar to the old genome selector in MicroScope but offers suggestion.

This selector is used in the homepage to select the reference genome
and more generally in pages where you must select a reference genome (e.g. :ref:`lineplot`).

It is also used for instance in the following pages:

  - :ref:`pattern_searches`

When the page opens, the selector is displayed like this (it may take some time to load):

.. image:: img/simple_selector.png

Note that the exact appearance of this selector may depend on the page.

To select an organism, type in some characters of its strain name.
A list of organisms matching this characters will open.
From this list, you can select the organism you want.

For example, if you type "esche", the following list will open:

.. image:: img/simple_selector_esche.png

Note that the search is case-insensitive.

Also you can type any character (not just the beginning).
For example, if you type "k12", the following list will open:

.. image:: img/simple_selector_k12.png

.. _advanced-selector:

*****************
Advanced Selector
*****************

This selector is used to select one or several sequences or genomes based on the NCBI taxonomy, strain name or :ref:`MICGC <micgc>`.

This selector is used for instance in the following pages:

  - :ref:`phyloprofile`
  - :ref:`blast_searches`

Overview
========

When the page opens, the selector is displayed like below (it may take some time to load):

.. image:: img/selector_closed.png

To start selecting organisms click on the **Edit** button.
The selector opens as shown below:


.. image:: img/selector_partname.png

You can now select your organism(s) by writing the organism name in the **search field**.
Select them by clicking on their name in the **pre-selection zone** (first selection zone) and
use the green arrow to transfer them in the **selection zone** (second selection zone).
You may add more genome to the **selection zone** using the same mechanism, or remove some of them using the red button.
When satisfied by the organism list in the **selection zone**, you can use them for your analysis by clicking on "Save".

Step by Step use
=================

Once the selector is open, you have to find the organism(s) you are interested in by using the **search field**

Pre-selection
-------------

The **pre-selection zone** allows you to see all organisms accessible of the platform and make filter on them before selecting them.

How the **search field** works ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing in the **search field**, will bring suggestions to you.
These suggestions can be changed by using the drop down menu on the left:

* - *Strain name*/*Sequence* filters by name of organism/sequence

.. image:: img/selector_search.PNG

* - *Taxonomy* filters by taxonomic information

.. image:: img/selector_search2.PNG

* - *MICGC* allows to select an entire :ref:`MICGC <micgc>` (organism group)


What are the filters ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using one of the suggestion will allow you to make filter, which is useful to pre-select the organisms you will want to work on.
Making a filter will put all the organisms following it in the **pre-selection zone**.
You can add several filters to improve the accuracy of your pre-selection.

.. image:: img/selector_filter.PNG

Here, we pre-select all the "Acinetobacter" and find 32 organisms.

.. image:: img/selector_filter2.PNG

We add to the "Acinetobacter" filter an other filter call "bauma" in order to select all the baumannii inside the Acinetobacter group. We pre-select 16 organisms.

What is the display menu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the display output of the **pre-selection zone** (and **selection zone**) by changing the value of the display drop down menu (top right of the screen).

.. image:: img/selector_display.PNG

The display by "species" with "Acinetobacter" filter active will group all pre-selected organism by species.

.. image:: img/selector_display2.PNG

The display by "genus" with "Acinetobacter" filter active will show all the 32 organisms in one single group.


How to select my organisms of interest?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To select you organisms, move the mouse with the button down on the wanted organisms in the **pre-selection zone** (shift + click works too).
Then press the green button to put them in the **selection zone**.


.. tip::
	* You can make your own filter by pressing *enter* at any time in the **search field**.
	* You can select the group of organism by double clicking on the bold tittle inside the **pre-selection zone**.

Selection zone
--------------

What is it for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **selection zone** is there to allow you to see all the selected organisms for the analysis.
You can remove some of them by moving the mouse with the button down and pressing the red button to remove them from the **selection zone**.
If the active filter allow them, they will appear in the **pre-selection zone**.

When you are satisfied with your selection, press the save button to continue the analysis.

What is "Advanced filter"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This part allow you to make filter in the **selection zone** to remove more efficiently organisms.
It works exactly the same as the first **search field**.

Other features
--------------

**Cancel** button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This button cancels all the changes done in the current selector (*i.e* the list of selected organisms is not changed).

**Reset** button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reset button will change both zones (**selection zone** and **pre-selection zone**) to their initial value (*i.e.* when the page was opened).

**Save** button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This button allows the save the list of organisms/sequences for further analysis.

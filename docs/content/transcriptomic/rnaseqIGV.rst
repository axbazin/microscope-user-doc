`Integrative Genomics Browser <http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/>`_ (IGV) is a third party software that enables the visualization of the coverage of the reference genome by transcripts and to qualitatively compare coverage for various experimental conditions.

First, click on “*Launch IGV*” button : users can use this one from the :ref:`RNA-Seq homepage <rnaseq_Overview>` or from :ref:`Read Count <rnaseq_ReadCountAnalysis>` and :ref:`DESeq Analysis <rnaseq_DiffExprAnalysis>` pages.

The first window appears with a lower part already displaying the annotations of the reference genome (see below).

Section **#1** contains genome annotations. Colors corresponding to a specific genomic object are:

* red : CDS
* yellow : fCDS
* green : tRNA
* blue : rRNA, miscRNA

To see genome coverage, users can load data in the drop down menu “*File/Load from Server*”.
A list of available datasets for import will then appear in a new window. Tick the checkbox corresponding to the experiments to load in the browser and click “*OK*”.

.. note:: **Warning**: The loading process may take a while, so please be patient!

Then, the coverage is visible :

Users can also organize the display :
*Example : to compare the same type of experiment user can group forward and reverse experiment. (just click and drag)*

Users can enlarge the view by drag’n dropping the mouse on the area of interest.

It is possible to zoom in to see gene sequence and translation.
